#Sweet HMAC

`SweetHMAC` is a tiny and easy to use Swift class to encrypt strings using HMAC algorithms.
A special thanks to [jernejstrasner](https://gist.github.com/jernejstrasner) for shared [HMACDigest Gist](https://gist.github.com/jernejstrasner/1d5fa5e2fabda2e729d1), that inspired to create this simple class and String extension.

## Usage examples

There are two ways to use Sweet HMAC in your projects

### 1. by String extension
```swift
// Will output this string: e470f785afb708cd8c2a31860642fd11
"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse".HMAC(.MD5, secret:"Vito Corleone")
```
	
### 2. by SweetHMAC class

```swift
let quote = "I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"
let author = "Vito Corleone"

// Create a SweetHMAC instance with your message and secret strings
let hmacEncrypt:SweetHMAC = SweetHMAC(source: quote, secret: author)

// Pick some computed HMAC output based on some algorithm using "HMAC" method...
let md5 = hmacEncrypt.HMAC(.MD5)

// ...or do it more "Sweet" like this
let md5 = SweetHMAC(source: quote, secret: author).HMAC(.MD5)
```

## Supported HMAC algorithms

* MD5
* SHA1
* SHA224
* SHA256
* SHA384
* SHA512

## Considerations

* I'm not tested this class in Mac and I don't see any reason to SweetHMAC not work in Mac OS X projects, feel free to fork this project an run tests over Mac OS X platform.
